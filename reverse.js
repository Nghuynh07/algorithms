//Given a numerical array, reverse the order of values, in-place. The reversed array should have the same length, with existing elements moved to other indices so that order of elements is reversed. Working 'in-place' means that you cannot use a second
// array â€“ move values within the array that you are given. As always, do not use built-in array functions such as splice().

  let temp;
  let i = 0;

  do {
    temp = array[i];
    array[i] = array[array.length - 1 - i];

    i++;
